It is another big boy at 15.4% natural alcohol. One of the strongest efforts yet from the Martinis, this cuvée still sells at a modest $38.00 [USD] – a fair price for something this compelling. The wine has an opaque purple color, a beautiful nose of blueberries, blackcurrants, licorice, camphor and graphite. The wine is full-bodied and multilayered on the palate with sensational richness and length. It should drink well for 20-25 years.” (October 2016)

Two thousand twelve is the vintage where endless trials and experiments in farming and winemaking are fully realized. The 2012 is just stunning. It's as simple as that.

All the concentration of the 2012 vintage is on display, but it's rendered with terrific finesse. Decidedly youthful and introverted-indeed, I spent several hours with a bottle to compose this note-the 2012 will really come into its own with five or six years in the cellar and displays all the attributes necessary for considerable longevity. It's a blend of 56% Pinot Noir and 44% Chardonnay that saw no malolactic fermentation, and it was disgorged with eight grams per liter dosage.  (Feb 2020)

From a long, moderate growing season, according to Silacci, this is fully formed, with gently mulled cassis and cherry preserve flavors that move slowly, yielding hints of savory and iron along the way. A broad swath of tannins emerges on the loamy finish, keeping this firmly grounded in terroir. Gorgeous. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Non-blind Opus One vertical (September 2019). Drink now through 2032. (2019).

Two of the strongest wines ever made at Opus One, the 2007 has terrific black currant fruit, licorice, incense, and subtle smoke, an opulent, even voluptuous mouthfeel, dazzling purity and texture, and a skyscraper-like mouthfeel. This is a sensational Opus One, with sweet tannin and impressive precision and depth. It can be drunk now or cellared for 25 years. Drink: 2009 - 2034. (December 2009)

The 2009 Opus One is impeccable. It brings together the silkiness of the 2007 with the power and darkness of the 2008, a combination that is hugely appealing, to say the least. With a little air, the 2009 can be enjoyed young, but it is best cellared for at least a few years, which will allow some of the baby fat to drop off. The blend is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot and 1% Malbec. (June 2013)

A glorious perfume of sweet charcoal, truffle, black currants and spice box soars from the glass of the saturated purple-colored 2010 Opus One. The gorgeous aromatics are followed by a beautifully knit, full-bodied red blend (84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5.5% Merlot, 5.5% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec) displaying lots of spicy black currant fruit, medium to full body, velvety tannins, and not a hard edge to be found. The texture, length and richness are all impressive. This estate has been making great Cabernet-based wines for nearly a decade ... and this is another one. Drink: 2013 - 2033.(October 2013).

Terrific classic Pauillac notes of blackcurrants, lead pencil shavings, leafy tobacco, and chocolate define this beauty, and it's medium to full-bodied, with a layered, balanced, pure character, present yet ripe tannins, and a great finish. As I wrote last year, it tastes more like a Grand Vin than a second wine. The larger Merlot component shows here compared to its more Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated big brother, and it's a much more plush, silky, sexy wine that already offers loads of pleasure. It's going to evolve for two decades and is well worth seeking out.""

The medium to full-bodied palate has an amazing sense of cohesiveness. There are no edges to the seamless flow of exquisitely fine-grained tannins and perfectly knit acidity, beautifully framing the blue and black fruits, which are at once elegant and also so, so rich.

This is the wine that surprised me the most when they were poured and I first put my nose in the glass. It feels floral, aromatic, clean, open and expressive like no other Gratallops that I remember. It seems quite marked by the Garnacha, with notes of Mediterranean herbs, red berries and fennel. For Alvaro Palacios, the wines from Gratallops have to have ripeness, not be very dark in color, with brightness, red rather than black fruit, not heavy, with the textured sensation of the slate soils. However, not all wines show the character of the village, as some people are still using foreign varieties, sometimes picking overripe, extracting too much and using too much oak, which hides the character of the wines. The wines have to be transparent. This Gratallops could very much represent the character of the place. All of the 2017s have very low pH, which is quite remarkable for the extremely warm and dry year. This has to be among the best Gratallops to date."" - Robert Parker's The Wine Advocate, (April, 2019)

When Michel Rolland was appointed consulting winemaker some years back, many feared the personality of Figeac would be lost. It is impossible for an outsider to truly know how small or large the impact of a single person is, but Figeac has indisputably been one of the very finest wines of the Right Bank over these last few years.

Lifted and electric start on the nose with a vivid aroma profile of sour cherries, dried apricots, nuts and sherry. The palate has sultanas and prunes with great tannins reminiscent of sawn oak. Lavenders and other floral notes appear. The palate is sweet and meaty at the same time. Very complex and entertaining with a lot of components and a great, layered texture. The finish is never ending. An outstanding example amongst other great whiskies.

Rather than charring the barrel with open flame, the toasting process exposes the barrel to a long and gentle heat at a level proprietary to Basil Hayden. The softer notes from the Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey receive the flavours from the toasted barrels, which is then blended back with non Toasted bourbon to add complex flavour grounded in sweet vanilla, complemented by rich toasted notes.

This year's iteration contains four straight whiskies of varying ages, distillation styles and resulting flavor profiles. A  2-year-old Kentucky straight bourbon, a 3-year-old 100% malted rye, a 5-year-old Kentucky straight bourbon, and a 15-year-old Kentucky straight bourbon. ""While younger whiskies–which make up the base of this blend–often carry certain preconceived notions, the 2-year-old bourbon and 3-year-old 100% malted rye have strong characteristics because of the way they were crafted, and they play a purposeful role in providing complex flavor and balance to this year's Little Book release,"" Freddie Noe explains.

A Cragganmore of this age has never been released from the distillery, making this elusive malt a much anticipated expression. In addition sweet and mellow woody notes emerge from this small batch, patiently matured over 20 years in a mix that included new fresh-charred American oak casks.  Showing the sweet and spicy effects of part maturation in new oak, this expression explores the woods just as deeply.. The texture is creamy-smooth while the taste is rich and not quite as sweet, delightfully balanced by a savoury mid-palate. The finish is long, velvety and spicy-dry.

The taste is intense, thick and syrupy, with sweetness partially offset by fruit tartness plus notes of concentrated cherry juice, cherry jam and black pepper spice.

First introduced to great acclaim in the Fall of 2014, Michter's US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon is a groundbreaking whiskey expression. It is made by taking Michter's US*1 Kentucky Straight Bourbon and then aging it for an additional period in a second custom-made barrel. This second barrel is assembled from 18-month air-dried wood and then toasted but not charred. Expect campfire and cinnamon notes with pecan and candied fruit plus a lingering finish of baked pears, vanilla and marshmallow.

“There’s evident age here, with dried leaves, old suede jacket, and dusty oak at the forefront, but underlying that maturity is plenty of dried fruit, figs, and cola.

The solid wood structure and oak tannins are here in abundance, but never out of balance.”

Oban Little Bay is everything that Oban 14 is, and more. A rich, fruity, malty nose showcases dried apricot, dark chocolate, and salt. On the palate, Little Bay explodes with flavor, combining malt with orange, chocolate, and blackberry. Clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate, which shows superb balance and integration. A long, slightly dry, citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky.” (Fall 2015)

Two Brewers Release 28 is a sweet and savoury whisky with pulpy fruit and toasted oak. This dram explores the dusky tones of sherry barrel aging. A blend of some of their oldest sherry-finished whisky with some younger body \-building mash, and re-barrelled in older sherry barrels for over two years of mingling. The darker sherry tones are prominent, not necessarily fruity. This is enhanced by the Hungarian oak in the older Pedro Ximénez sherry casks.
